# Web-Scraping

BeautifulSoup, best tool to scrape the data from a website. All the requirements were fulfilled by this library. For python version 3+, I had to import library bs4. And using that I scrape the table I needed by opening the url in my python program itself from the website which was a very easy task using this beautiful tool called beautiful soup.
